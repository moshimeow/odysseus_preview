Hi! Things to know:
* I animate the camera trajectory by hand the normal way. Look up a tutorial on that.
* For the second stereo camera, I just offset it on the X axis and parent it to the left camera
* In Properties Pane -> Output, I check "stereoscopy" , make sure my cameras are suffixed with _R and _L
    * Later, for super-high-FOV cameras, we'll make a camera rig made of multiple 90-deg FOV cameras, but that's for later
* In Properties Pane -> Scene, I make sure that one of those two cameras were set as active
* Then I just hit "Render animation", using jpeg images bc smol.
