goals:
more extensive frontend simulation
- markov detection + noise simulation
- budget tracked frames
- keypoint detection on rendered images
- distortion simulation + distortion correction in backend

better metrics generally

stronger parameter ordering

GBA marginalization

mini GBA

sparse prior

optical flow first step pose estimation

frame graph refactor

memory usage refactor

learning modules for jets, levenberg marquardt, and beyond



Documentation topics:
* Why quaternion instead of rotation matrix for SO3?
    * Double cover helps us when one of the angles is at pi, whereas rotation matrices make the derivatives go in the wrong direction!
* Why do we parametrize as rotvec relative to a quaternion?
    * Better numerical stability, taylor expansion when very close to zero (important for numerical stability -and- faster)
    * Makes it way easier to think about confidence when we know it's expressed as a relatively low angle
    * Makes it way easier to change the world (we just transform all the positions and quaternions)
* Why, oh why, do we call it "tangent space?" Can we stop calling it that or is there a good reason?
* Why inverse depth instead of vec3? (Why is vec3 so much simpler?)
