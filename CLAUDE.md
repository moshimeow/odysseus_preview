Hi Claude! Thanks for being here!

When running odysseus-slam/examples/incremental_slam_demo.rs , it is necessary to first cd into odysseus-slam, it needs to access data files found in that folder.

See odysseus-solver/SPRS_NOTES.md for documentation on using the sprs sparse matrix library (trait bounds, gotchas, etc).
